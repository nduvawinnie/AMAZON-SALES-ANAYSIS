# **Executive Summary: Amazon Sales Analysis**

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive **Sales Analytics Dashboard** built using real-world-inspired Amazon sales data. It was developed as an educational and portfolio project to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis using Power BI.

The dashboard provides stakeholders with a dynamic, visual summary of key business metrics — including total sales, profit, customer count, discount trends, and regional performance — over a four-year period (2022–2025). It enables deep insights across multiple dimensions such as geography, product line, customer segment, and time.

The project simulates how retail and e-commerce companies like Amazon utilize business intelligence tools to monitor performance, identify opportunities, and support strategic decision-making. It also showcases technical proficiency in:

- **Data preparation** with Power Query  
- **Data modeling** and relationship design  
- **DAX calculations** for dynamic KPIs and metrics  
- **Visual design and storytelling** using Power BI  

⚠️ *Disclaimer: This project was created strictly for educational and non-commercial use. The dataset used is a simulated version based on public patterns and does not represent actual Amazon data.*

## Business Context & Research Questions

In today's fast-paced e-commerce landscape, companies like Amazon rely heavily on data-driven insights to drive strategic decisions. With millions of transactions happening across countries, regions, and product categories, it becomes essential for business leaders to have a clear view of performance metrics such as sales, profit, customer behavior, and product trends.

This project simulates how a data analyst can support executive decision-making by building an interactive Amazon sales dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard enables stakeholders to filter data by time, region, segment, and product to monitor trends, identify opportunities, and manage performance.

**Tools Used:** Power BI, Power Query, DAX  
**Disclaimer:** This dashboard was built strictly for educational purposes using simulated real-world data. It does not represent actual Amazon operations or proprietary data.

## 📊 Methodology & Technical Approach

### 🔧 Data Preparation

* **Data Cleaning:** Used Power Query to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure consistent date formatting.
* **Data Transformation:** Created new calculated columns (e.g., Profit Margin, Year, Month) for analysis.
* **Data Modeling:** Established relationships between fact tables and dimension tables for accurate filtering and drill-down analysis.

### 📈 Analytical Approach

* **KPIs Defined:** Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin %, Quantity Sold, and Discount Impact.
* **DAX Measures:** Used DAX formulas to calculate dynamic metrics such as Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales, Profit Margin, and Region-wise contributions.
* **Filters & Slicers:** Added interactive filters for Year, Region, Segment, and Product to enable stakeholders to explore data.

### 📊 Dashboard Development

* **Visualization:** Used bar charts, line charts, and cards to highlight key metrics.
* **User Experience:** Applied consistent colors, clean layout, and slicers for interactivity.
* **Validation:** Cross-checked totals and calculations against raw data to ensure accuracy.



## <span style="color:black">Data Quality & Challenges</span>

### 🔍 Data Quality Assessment

* **Completeness:** Dataset was well-structured with no missing critical fields.
* **Consistency:** Date formats and currency values were standardized using Power Query.
* **Accuracy:** Data is simulated but designed to closely mimic real-world Amazon sales transactions.

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced

* **Date Formatting:** Required transformation to a consistent YYYY-MM-DD format for time intelligence in Power BI.
* **Profit Calculations:** Some rows had negative profits (losses) that required careful validation.
* **Data Granularity:** Multiple products per order required grouping and aggregation to get accurate order-level totals.

### ✅ Resolution

* Applied Power Query transformations for data cleaning.
* Used DAX to create calculated columns for profit margin and validated results.
* Ensured relationships were correctly set between tables to avoid double counting.

> 📌 **Note:** These challenges are common in real-world projects and were addressed to ensure reliable insights in the dashboard.
