# **Executive Summary: Amazon Sales Analysis**

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive **Sales Analytics Dashboard** built using real-world-inspired Amazon sales data. It was developed as an educational and portfolio project to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis using Power BI.

The dashboard provides stakeholders with a dynamic, visual summary of key business metrics ‚Äî including total sales, profit, customer count, discount trends, and regional performance ‚Äî over a four-year period (2022‚Äì2025). It enables deep insights across multiple dimensions such as geography, product line, customer segment, and time.

The project simulates how retail and e-commerce companies like Amazon utilize business intelligence tools to monitor performance, identify opportunities, and support strategic decision-making. It also showcases technical proficiency in:

- **Data preparation** with Power Query  
- **Data modeling** and relationship design  
- **DAX calculations** for dynamic KPIs and metrics  
- **Visual design and storytelling** using Power BI

## Business Context & Research Questions

In today's fast-paced e-commerce landscape, companies like Amazon rely heavily on data-driven insights to drive strategic decisions. With millions of transactions happening across countries, regions, and product categories, it becomes essential for business leaders to have a clear view of performance metrics such as sales, profit, customer behavior, and product trends.

This project simulates how a data analyst can support executive decision-making by building an interactive Amazon sales dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard enables stakeholders to filter data by time, region, segment, and product to monitor trends, identify opportunities, and manage performance.

**Tools Used:** Power BI, Power Query, DAX  
**Disclaimer:** This dashboard was built strictly for educational purposes using simulated real-world data. It does not represent actual Amazon operations or proprietary data.
