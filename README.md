# **Executive Summary: Amazon Sales Analysis**

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive **Sales Analytics Dashboard** built using real-world-inspired Amazon sales data. It was developed as an educational and portfolio project to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis using Power BI.

The dashboard provides stakeholders with a dynamic, visual summary of key business metrics — including total sales, profit, customer count, discount trends, and regional performance — over a four-year period (2022–2025). It enables deep insights across multiple dimensions such as geography, product line, customer segment, and time.

The project simulates how retail and e-commerce companies like Amazon utilize business intelligence tools to monitor performance, identify opportunities, and support strategic decision-making. It also showcases technical proficiency in:

- **Data preparation** with Power Query  
- **Data modeling** and relationship design  
- **DAX calculations** for dynamic KPIs and metrics  
- **Visual design and storytelling** using Power BI  

⚠️ *Disclaimer: This project was created strictly for educational and non-commercial use. The dataset used is a simulated version based on public patterns and does not represent actual Amazon data.*
